        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi my name is Montserrat Marroquin. I graduated from the California Academy of Math and Science in the year 2021 and now I am a pre-business major at the University of California, Riverside(UCR). At the moment, I am an undergraduate but Iâ€™m working towards graduating UCR with a bachelor's degree and possibly a master's degree in business. I love taking advantage of the opportunities UCR has to offer such as the work study position in dining services, the Latino Business Student Association, and the womenâ€™s club soccer team. One day, I hope the money I save can help me accomplish my dream of studying abroad. During my summers I work as an assistant for a transportation service company. Some days I am working in their storage unit organizing files, while other days Iâ€™m in the office making the files. As their assistant, my favorite work task is handling any and all new job applicant entries. In other words, I make the application, make sure the applicant is eligible to be an applicant, and save their application if the interview I set up for them goes well. I feel this experience gives me the best idea of what to do and not to do for future interviews from the way they dress to the way they speak. 
<br><br>

        During the school year, I work on campus for UCR Dining Services. Last year, I worked for their Glasgow residential hall and this year I work for their Lothian residential hall. The work for both residential areas is very similar, however I was recently picked to be trained for cashiering. I can confidently say that I am trainable. In addition, I am a fast learner who is unafraid of asking questions to become a better worker. I managed to cashier without having to be supervised after 2 days, and within a week they were confident in letting students shadow me as cashier so they could learn to be cashiers too. Although cashiering is a great stepping stone in my career progression, I miss working one on one with chefs. When I would help prepare food for the day I felt I learned from leaders everyday. One chef told me he had no specialty dish because he does not want to limit himself to only being great or known for one dish. I would like to proceed my life with that mentality of expanding my skill set so that I do not limit myself by defining myself.
<br><br>

        I do not want to stay in the positions I hold in my communities for long. I want to be more than just a member. For my school job I want to become a supervisor, for soccer and LBSA I want a board position, and I want to claim a business concentration in school. I know it will take hours of my time, dedication, and hard work to achieve my goals but I am so okay with knowing I earned my accomplishments at the end of the day.
